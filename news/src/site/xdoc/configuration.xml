			<p>The News Tool currently supports three means of defining RSS 
			feed information for use: file based configuration, web service 
			based configuration, and database configuration.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section name="File Based Configuration">
			<p>The News Tool comes preconfigured with several sample RSS feeds
			for use in testing.  These feeds are configured using a simple
			XML file.  A sample file named newsSources.xml can be found in 
			the news-impl project in src/test/resources/.  A sample is shown 
			below:</p>
			<source><![CDATA[
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<newsSources>
	<newsSource>
		<name>BBC - News</name>
		<url>http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml</url>
		<order>0</order>
		<active>true</active>
	</newsSource>
	<newsSource>
		<name>CNN.com - World</name>
		<url>http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss</url>
		<order>1</order>
		<active>true</active>
	</newsSource>
</newsSources>]]>
			</source>
			<p>This file may be included anywhere within the web application's 
			classpath.</p>
			<p>To use the newsSources.xml file, you must update the 
			NewsSpringBeans.xml in the news-webapp project's src/main/resources/
			directory as shown below.</p>
			<source><![CDATA[
    <bean id="newsDao" class="org.kuali.mobility.news.dao.NewsDaoImpl">
        <property name="mapper" ref="mapper"/>
        <property name="newsSourceFile" value="newsSources.xml"/>
        <property name="newsMappingFile" value="newsSourcesMapping.xml"/>
        <property name="cache" ref="newsCache"/>
    </bean>
			]]></source>
			<p>The above configuration of the DAO will look for newsSources.xml
			in the web application's WEB-INF/classes/ directory and load the 
			RSS feeds from it.</p>
